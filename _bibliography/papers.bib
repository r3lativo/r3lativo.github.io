    abstract = "How effective are the communication choices of Multimodal Large Language Models when pursuing a common goal? 
  Can they make use of common human dialogical patterns? 
  We address these questions by engaging two agents based on the Mistral model in a collaborative building task, where one has to instruct the other how to build a specific target structure. 
  The aim of this work is to investigate whether different prompting techniques with varying degrees of multimodality can influence the performance of MLLM-based agents in the proposed task. Code and data available in the project's GitHub repository."
