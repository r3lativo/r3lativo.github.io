Ciao! I'm Giovanni.

I'm a Cognitive Science Master's student at the University of Trento (CIMeC), currently writing my Master's thesis with the ALMAnaCH team at Inria in Paris.

My work focuses on how to make AI more cooperative and context-aware. I'm particularly interested in building dialogue systems that can dynamically ground their conversations to improve human-computer interaction. My approach is grounded in a deep interest in linguistics and how culture shapes communicationâ€”a perspective I developed during my B.A. in Comparative Languages. I'm also passionate about privacy, ethics, and their implications in our rapidly developing digital world.

I'm actively seeking PhD or Research Engineer positions where I can help build more socially and ethically-conscious AI.

Outside of my research, you'll probably find me enjoying a film, a concert, or a museum, talking about the last book I read, or heading out for a hike.
